The node_modules folder is not uploaded to GitHub due to its large size. To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

Steps to Install Node Modules
Ensure you have Node.js installed

Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org if not already installed.
Open the project directory in a terminal

Navigate to the root folder of the project where package.json is located.
Run the following command to install dependencies:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will download and install all the required packages listed in package.json.

Start the project (if applicable):

If your project has a start script, run:
sh
Copy
Edit
npm start
If it's a development environment, use:
sh
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Notes
node_modules is ignored in .gitignore to keep the repository clean.
If you face any issues, ensure you have the correct Node.js version and package-lock.json is not missing.
